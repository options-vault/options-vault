### A Decentralized Options Yield Strategy To Generate Income On Your Crypto 

Options yield vaults give you the ability to allocate your crypto to an automated options strategy to generate income. 
All you need to do is deposit crypto into our vault and the Clarity smart contracts execute a simple [covered call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp) 
options arbitrage strategy for you.

This strategy sells one week options contracts (represented as NFTs) against the crypto in the vault. Since the strike price of the 
option is 15% above the underlying spot price, most of the weekly option contracts expiry worthless (the option is ["out-of-the-money"](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/o/out-of-the-money)).

The net result is a strategy that in bearish and mildly bullish market conditions puts a stead stream of income payments in
the investor's pocket. Only in extremely bullish market conditions, with fast and steep price appreciations, does the strategy become unprofitable.

### Why Options Arbitrage?

Derivatives arbitrage strategies are a time-tested way to generate yield. Using options and futures contracts, these strategies can generate steady income
streams in specific market conditions **without liquidation risk**.

Most importantly though the strategies' success does not rely on the emission of inflationary protocol tokens as widely observed in [Automated Market Making](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers) protocols.
This makes the strategies inherently **sustainable** and gives the user the ability to generate income in bearish market conditions.

### Why Automation Via Smart Contracts?

A certain level of financial acumen is required to execute these strategies successfully and therefore, in the traditional financial system, they have mainly been employed by financial institutions and sophisticated high net worth individuals.

We believe that by automating the execution using Clarity smart contracts we can make these strategies available to a much wider audience. In our opinion, this is a crucial step towards a truly open and democratized financial system. A financial system that makes sophisticated arbitrage strategies accessible to anybody with a Stacks account and without the need to give up custody over your assets.

Stacks is in a unique position to become the smart contracting layer for Bitcoin and by extension the home of Bitcoin DeFi. In making sustainable yield strategies available on Stacks we believe that we can help unlock the ecosystem's potential and contribute to accelerated user adoption.
